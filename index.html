    <h1 style="color:blue">The coding wizard</h1>
    <p style="width:300px"> Hello and welcome to my blog. This is an ongoing project that i want to enable and improve the coding skillset of aspiring coders.
      As a self-taught coder, i realize that we need each other to help speed up the learning process. So much to learn and so little time.
      The first language i learnt was Visual Basic for Applications, and i used it to script Excel applications. Next, i decided to learn HTML
      and CSS to build websites. And this blog is the first web site i am building from scratch. I hope you will enjoy!
